# AutoFix AI

AutoFix AI is a small experiment that explores how an AI model can write code, generate tests, run them, and fix errors automatically.

The project uses Gemini 3 to generate a Node.js solution, create test cases, and iteratively improve the code based on test failures.

## How to Run

```bash
npm install
node agent.js
